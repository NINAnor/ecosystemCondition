</h2>
<p>This indicator represent the the ecological on-site effect from alien species. In practice, the indicator is restricted to alien vascular plants. Whilst the introduction of alien species is best considered a pressure variable, the relative abundance of alien species on a given location is seen here as a manifestation of this negative anthropogenic impact, and is therefore a valid condition indicator.</p>
<p>A related variable has been used previously for <a href="https://ninanor.github.io/IBECA/faktaark.html#Frav%C3%A6r_av_fremmede_arter">alpine</a> and forest ecosystems in Norway. These indicators were based on ANO, a national monitoring program, where alien species cover was estimated to the closest whole percent. The upper and lower reference levels that was used back then was 0 or 100% of the species composition made up of alien species, respectively. The threshold value between good and reduced condition was defined as 5%. In this approach, the indicator represented the relative area with an absence of alien species. It is in a way the flip-side of <em>alien species abundance</em>. The latter was said to be a pressure variable, whilst the former reacts as direct and linear consequence of changes to this variable, and was therefore accepted as a condition indicator. We do not make this distinction here.</p>
<p>This time we are using the <a href="naturtype.html#naturtype">nature type mapping dataset</a> which records the assumed <em>effect</em> of alien species, rather than a direct measure of abundance such as percentage cover. The recording scale is called R7 (Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:R7">5.1</a>) and is an ordinal scale which has a non-linear relationship with percentage cover recorded in ANO (Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:fremmedart-prosentVSinnslag">5.2</a>). In order to combine these two data sets, we must convert one of these scales to match the other.</p>
<p>Here I base the indicator on the R7 scale, since this is, presumably, the bigger data set. I therefore convert percentage cover into R7 classes based on what I can interpret from Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:fremmedart-prosentVSinnslag">5.2</a>.</p>
<p>Upper reference value is then 1, and lower reference value is 7, on the R7 scale.
For the threshold value I will set this to value 3 on the R7 scale.
This is based on interpretation by the author and based of the definition of this value in Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:R7">5.1</a>.
Step 3 on the R7 scale is the step that, concordantly, best matches the 5% threshold in the old approach, as seen from Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:fremmedart-prosentVSinnslag">5.2</a>.</p>
<p>The indicator is calculated separately for the three ecosystems, but all nature types associated with the same ecosystem are pooled and treated equally. This means we assume the nature types that are mapped and which we have data from are, when pooled, representative for the main ecosystem. This is less true for Naturally open ecosystems than it is for the other two. You can read more about that <a href="naturtype.html#naturtype">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since the nature type data is not sampled in a systematic or random way, we must take extra care not to over-extrapolate in space. We delineate <em>homogeneous impact areas</em> (HIA) based on four classes of increasing infrastructure intersected with municipality borders, and we say that if we have more than <em>n</em> data points then this field data is representative inside the entire HIA. In <a href="#slitasje-og-kj%C3%B8respor">a related indicator</a> we used the accounting areas to define the HIA (5 accounting areas in Norway), in addition to the infrastructure classes. For this indicator, we expect more gradients also inside accounting areas, and therefore we define HIAs based on municipalities. This means that there will be more missing data in our final indicator maps, since not all municipalities will have sufficient data points to estimate indicator values.</p>
<p>We then calculate an area weighted mean (and error) indicator value for each HIA, as long as there is more than <em>n</em> data points for a given combination of HIA and municipality.</p>
<p>Here a general workflow for the calculation of the indicator.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> About the underlying data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#about-data-ali"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The indicator uses a data set from a standardised field survey of nature
types. You can read more about this data set from my preliminary analyses
<a href="naturtype.html#naturtype">here</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/ansvarsomrader/overvaking-arealplanlegging/naturkartlegging/naturtyper/">official
site</a>
of the Environment Agency. I also import a data set called
<a href="alien-species.html#ANO-import2">ANO</a>, which you can read about
<a href="https://www.miljodirektoratet.no/ansvarsomrader/overvaking-arealplanlegging/miljoovervaking/overvakingsprogrammer/natur-pa-land/arealrepresentativ-naturovervakning-ano/">here</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The nature type mapping is not random and cannot be said to be area
representative.
This will not improve over time either.</p>
<p>The ANO data set however, is area representative. The
data is from 2018 to present. The data from one field season usually
becomes available early the following year.</p>
<p>Regarding update frequency, the Nature type data set is not replicated, nor will it be in the future. We must therefore trust that the selection criteria for which areas to survey will not change drastically and systematically over time. For example, we are now surveying a lot in pressure areas, meaning lowland areas close to human population centers. If we in the future allocate more time to surveying wilderness areas, then the indicator becomes biased. On the other hand, ANO is replicated every 5 years.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.6</span> Uncertainties<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#uncertainties-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Uncertainties/errors are estimated for aggregated indicator values by
bootstrapping individual indicator values 1000 times and calculating a
distribution of area weighted means. This uncertainty is different from
the spatial variation which we could get more straightforward without
bootstrapping. When aggregating a second time,
from homogeneous impact areas to accounting areas, we assume a normal
distribution around the indicator values, with the already mentioned

a new, area-weighted, distribution. The errors for the accounting areas
thus represents both the spatial variation and the precision of the

<p>This indicator uses the data set
<code>Naturtyper etter Miljødirektoratets Instruks</code>, which can be found
<a href="https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/naturtyper-miljoedirektoratets-instruks/eb48dd19-03da-41e1-afd9-7ebc3079265c">here</a>.
See also <a href="naturtype.html#naturtype">here</a> for a detailed description of the data set.</p>
<p>We also have a separate <a href="#id_#exp-natureType-summary">summary file</a> where
the nature types are manually mapped to the NiN variables and to the correct NiN-main types.
We can use this to find the nature types of interest.</p>

<p>This variable (7FA) is also recorded in
<a href="https://www.nina.no/Naturmangfold/Trua-natur/%C3%85pen-grunnlendt-kalkmark">GRUK</a>.
The nature type data set I’m working on here includes this data already
(presently only 2021 included). GRUK also records a related variable:
<code>% cover in 5m radii circles</code>, which is much more detailed. This data is
not published. In any case it is better to use the harmonized data set
in our case.</p>

<p>Arealrepresentativ Naturovervåking (ANO) consist of 1000 systematically
placed locations in Norway, each with 18 sample points. In each sample point, a
circle of 250 m<sup>2</sup> is inspected, and the main ecosystem is recorded.</p>
<p>The percentage cover of alien vascular plant is estimated, irrespective of main ecosystem type.
In contrast to the nature type data set, ANO only looks at vascular plants, and then also only the three highest impact categories
of the Alien Species List (SE, HI, PH). It is therefore not completely unproblematic to combine these to data sets,
but we will do so anyway. We expect plants to be the by far most common species group to influence the 7FA variable as well.
And similarly, we expect the three highest impact categories to contain the most widespread species, which will
drive the 7FA variable more than the other categories.</p>

<p>This data set only contains data from year 2019 and 2021. We need to
update this data set later. It is not clear why there is no data from
2020.</p>
<p>Each point/row here is 250 square meters. The data also contains
information about how big a proportion of this area is made up of the
dominant main ecosystem. However, there are
215
NA’s here, which is 20% of the data.</p>
<p>It appears the proportion of each circle that is made up of the dominant
ecosystem was only recorded after year 2019. In fact, the main ecosystem
was not recorded at all in 2019:</p>

<p>We can see that people tend to record the variable in steps of 5%, and
that most sample points are 100% belonging to the same main ecosystem.</p>
<p>We want to use area weighting in this indicator, so we can use this
percentage cover data to calculate the area. Note that both data sets
use m<sup>2</sup> as area units.</p>

<p>The ANO localities seemingly have less alien plants in them than the nature type localities. This can be due to sampling biases in the latter.</p>
<p>Now I will convert these percentage cover values into 7FA classes. This is a critical step, since there is no one-to-one mapping here,
but rather there is considerable overlap, as can be seen in Fig. <a href="alien-species.html#fig:fremmedart-prosentVSinnslag">5.2</a>.</p>

<p>I can scale the indicator for each polygon, or I can chose to aggregate
them first. If the scaled value is representative and precise at the
polygon level, then I could scale at that level. I think they are.</p>
<p>However, the combined surveyed area is a very small fraction of the
total area of Norway, so that only producing indicator values for the
mapped areas leaves the indicator without much value for regional
assessments. But we cannot simply do an area weighting of the polygons
in each region. This is because we expect considerable sampling bias
and we can’t assume that the
polygons are representative far outside of the mapped area. But perhaps
we can assume them to be representative inside <em>homogeneous ecological
areas,</em> or <em>Homogeneous Impact Areas</em> (HIAs). That’s where the
infrastructure index comes in. Here’s the plan:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>normalise the indicators at the polygon level.</p></li>
<li><p>take a simplified infrastructure index (vector data) and intersect this with municipality borders to produce a map of homogeneous impact areas (HIAs).</p></li>
<li><p>extract the corresponding indicator values that intersect with a
given HIA, and extrapolate the area weighted mean of those values to
the entire HIA. Errors are
calculated from bootstrapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Take the new area weighted indicator values for the HIAs, rasterize it, and mask these
with ecosystem occurrences. The errors are the same as for the HIAs.</p></li>
<li><p>calculate an indicator value for a region (accounting area) by doing
a weighted average based on the relative area of ecosystem
occurrences. Errors should be carried somehow, perhaps via weighted
resampling.</p></li>

<p>I want to use the <a href="alien-species.html#HIA">Homogeneous Impact Areas</a> (HIA) to define
smaller regions into which I can extrapolate the indicator values. This
data is generated by discretizing the Norwegian Infrastructure Index. I
refer to the ordinal values of the four HIA classes as their <em>Human
Impact Factor</em> (HIF). This is just to keep the approach separate from
the Norwegian Infrastructure Index.</p>

<p>I want to check that HIF is in fact a good predictor for <em>alien species</em>.</p>
<p>I also want to split these four HIA classes based on municipality.
For a <a href="slitasje.html#HIA-slitasje">related indicator</a> I used combinations of HIA and region, but for alien species I think
that there is too much variation also inside each region (esp north-south) so that we need a finer division of strata.
To do this I need the two layers to have the same CRS.</p>

<p>Here is a similar figure, looking at the relative frequency of indicator level of polygons and within each HIA.</p>

<p>The figure above I think supports the indicator-pressure relationship
and justifies using the HIA x municipality intersections as local reference
areas.</p>
<p>Let us look at the effect of sample size on the indicator uncertainty.</p>

<p>This shows that the uncertainty is really inflated with sample sizes less than about 50-100.</p>

<p>I now want to find the mean indicator value for each HIA (i.e. to
aggregate) and to <em>spread</em> these out spatially to the entire HIA (i.e. to extrapolate).</p>
<p>I want to add a threshold so that we don’t end up over extrapolating
based on too few data points. I will use 20 data points as a minimum.</p>

<p>It’s easier to see what’s happening if we zoom in a bit. I will look more closely at three example municipalities:</p>
<p>Trondheim (municipality nr 5001), Nordre Follo (3020) and Målselv (5418).</p>

<p>Figure <a href="alien-species.html#fig:extrapolated-alien">5.17</a> again indicates that this indicator will have a lot of missing data (see also <a href="alien-species.html#alien-data-coverage">here</a>). For Nordre Follo and Trondheim for example, we do not have any indicator values tied to naturally open or wetland ecosystems, and for semi natural ecosystems we only have data for HIF class 2. This is, however, still a lot better than discarding the entire data set due to issues related to area representativity. The amount of missing data in the indicator maps is closely tied to the chosen threshold value for how many data points we must have in order to calculate an (area weighted) mean indicator value. We have used 20 as the threshold here. For Målselv (far right column), we ended up having enough data for wetlands in HIF class 0, and since most of the municipality is in this HIF class we get a lot of indicator coverage.</p>
<p>The following table contains the data values underlying Figure <a href="alien-species.html#fig:extrapolated-alien">5.17</a>, including HIAs with &lt;20 data points.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="alien-species.html#fig:relative-area">5.20</a> shows us that this indicator will provide indicator values for about 20% of the semi-natural ecosystem, and considerably less for the other two ecosystems. The data coverage is very sensitive to the threshold for minimum data points, set to &gt;20 in this case. Also, with more nature type data accumulating over time, the data coverage will increase. Therefore I think this indicator is worthwhile, and that this is considerably better than the alternative to discard the entire data set.</p>

<p>From here it is easy to get zonal statistics using <code>exactextratr</code>. If I have this kind of map for all of Norway I can get the mean value for the regions (defined via a polygon set) and it will of course be area weighted (but no weight given to ecosystem occurences that don’t have indicator values).</p>
