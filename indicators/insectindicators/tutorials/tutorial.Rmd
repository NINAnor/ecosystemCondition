Intro
======
Not much here yet, only some quick commands.

```{r}
library(Norimon)
```
```{r}
connect_to_insect_db()
```

```{r}
require(DBI)
 require(dplyr)
locations <- tbl(con,
                 Id(schema = "locations",
                    table = "localities"))


```
```{r}
locations
```
```{r}
require(sf)

locations_sf <- read_sf(con,
                 Id(schema = "locations",
                    table = "localities"))


```
```{r}
require(ggplot2)

ggplot(locations_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = habitat_type))
```


New locality function
---------

```{r}
insect_localities_sf <- get_localities()
```

```{r}
insect_localities <- get_localities(as_sf = FALSE)
```
